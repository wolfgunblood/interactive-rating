## Overview

The Interactive Rating Card is a user interface component that allows users to rate and provide feedback on a particular item, such as a product, service, or experience. It provides a visually appealing and interactive way for users to express their opinions and experiences.

The rating card typically includes a visual representation of the rating scale, which can be represented by stars, thumbs up/down, smiley faces, or any other relevant symbols. Users can click or interact with these symbols to select their desired rating.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
